Cyber Hygiene scans of your host(s) conducted in the past day have detected one or more of the following:

As part of BOD 19-02, critical findings need to be remediated within 15 days and high findings remediated within 30 days.

As part of BOD 22-01, any "known exploited" findings, regardless of severity, need to be remediated within two weeks.

CISA also recommends reviewing hosts with potentially risky open services (e.g. RDP, Telnet, etc.), especially if they are functioning as networked management interfaces, to ensure that each service is intended to be available to the public and, where applicable, the service is up-to-date, correctly configured, and uses strong authentication.

As part of BOD 23-02, networked management interfaces exposed to the public internet must either be removed from the internet by making it only accessible from an internal enterprise network or protected by capabilities that enforce access control to the interface through a policy enforcement point separate from the interface itself as part of a Zero Trust Architecture within 14 days.

CISA recommends remediating known exploited vulnerabilities, regardless of severity, within two weeks.

CISA also recommends reviewing hosts with potentially risky open services (e.g. RDP, Telnet, etc.), especially if they are functioning as networked management interfaces, to ensure that each service is intended to be available to the public and, where applicable, the service is up-to-date, correctly configured, and uses strong authentication.
